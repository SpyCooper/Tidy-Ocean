## Project Description
"Tidy Ocean" is a game where you collect trash for money. Through the game, you will get bigger boats that can pick up more and bigger trash. The game ends when you are able to collect all the trash within 1 day.

As you collect trash, your boat's inventory will fill up until you can't hold any more trash and all trash will be unable to be picked up. The next time you return to the dock, all the trash will be removed from your inventory and you will get trash based on the trash you picked up. Bigger and harder to pick up trash will give more money.

Once the player gets enough trash and return to the dock, their boat will automatically upgrade to the next tier and remove that money from the player's cash.

After the timer in the top right runs out, the next day will begin. The player will lose all non-deposited trash, be respawned at the dock, and the trash on the screen will reset. The player does not have their cash reset between days.

If the player hits the boundaries of the map or a freighter, they will lose 1 random piece of trash from their inventory if they have any.
